# Snapshot

Created as part of our final 2 week graduation project at &lt;/salt&gt; by Eoghain Oâ€™Briain, Oleksander Cheban (https://github.com/alexcheban89) & Ville Viljanen (https://github.com/vivilCODE).

Our project is called Snapshot. It is a mobile first web application that allows users to browse as well as upload photographs and videos. The location of the upload is captured and presented using a marker on the map to give the site visitor a 'snapshot' of what is going on in a certain area. Non-signed-in users can search by location, or filter the results on the main page, by most or least viewed, highest or lowest ranked and by newest or oldest. They can also view the post to read the description and comments. Signed-in users can also leave comments under all posts, as well as upvote or downvote posts and upload media to the site. They can also use the site's messenger to contact other site members, view their own profile page and delete their own posts if they wish.

For Snapshot we used the MERN stack. We used Mongoose alongside MongoDB to allow us to use schemas, Express on the backend, React for the front end and NodeJS. For the messenger we utilized socket.io and for hosting and media storage we used Heroku and Cloudinary respectively. In terms of external APIs we used Google authentication and Google maps.
